# Welcome to Discovero!

After a year of being out in the wild, Discovero - Redefined returns with almost every aspect of the site improved. Performance is now better with the help of refactored JavaScript code. Mobile navigation has also been vastly improved by newly added media queries. The heart of the project - the 360 degrees landmarks - are better than ever, using brand new and proprietary code written specially for this website.

**In short - everything has been improved and the project has finally achieved its end,** but new cities and landmarks are coming soon!
