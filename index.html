        <div class="info-section"><img class="back" src="img/back.svg" alt="back"><span>Bucharest</span>
          <p>Bucharest is the capital and largest city of Romania, as well as its cultural, industrial, and financial centre. It is located in the southeast of the country, on the banks of the Dâmbovița River, less than 60 km (37.3 mi) north of the Danube River and the Bulgarian border.</p>
          <p>Bucharest was first mentioned in documents in 1459. It became the capital of Romania in 1862 and is the centre of Romanian media, culture, and art. Its architecture is a mix of historical (neo-classical and Art Nouveau), interbellum (Bauhaus, and art deco), communist era and modern. In the period between the two World Wars, the city's elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of 'Paris of the East' or 'Little Paris' . Although buildings and districts in the historic city centre were heavily damaged or destroyed by war, earthquakes, and even Nicolae Ceaușescu's program of systematization, many survived and have been renovated. In recent years, the city has been experiencing an economic and cultural boom. It is one of the fastest-growing high-tech cities in Europe, according to Financial Times, CBRE, TechCrunch and others. UiPath, a global startup founded in Bucharest, has reached $7 billion in valuation. Since 2019, Bucharest hosts the largest high tech summit in Southeast Europe (Romania Blockchain Summit).</p>
          <p>In 2016, the historical city centre was listed as 'endangered' by the World Monuments Watch. In 2017, Bucharest was the European city with the highest growth of tourists who stay over night, according to the Mastercard Global Index of Urban Destinations. As for the past two consecutive years, 2018 and 2019, Bucharest ranked as the European destination with the highest potential for development according to the same study.</p>
          <p>According to the 2011 census, 1,883,425 inhabitants live within the city limits, a decrease from the 2002 census. Adding the satellite towns around the urban area, the proposed metropolitan area of Bucharest would have a population of 2.27 million people. According to Eurostat, Bucharest has a functional urban area of 2,412,530 residents (as of 2015). Bucharest is the fifth largest city in the European Union by population within city limits, after Berlin, Madrid, Rome, and Paris. Economically, Bucharest is the most prosperous city in Romania. The city has a number of large convention facilities, educational institutes, cultural venues, traditional 'shopping arcades' and recreational areas. The city proper is administratively known as the 'Municipality of Bucharest', and has the same administrative level as that of a national county, being further subdivided into six sectors, each governed by a local mayor.</p>
          <p>The Romanian name București has an unverified origin. Tradition connects the founding of Bucharest with the name of Bucur, who was a prince, an outlaw, a fisherman, a shepherd or a hunter, according to different legends. In Romanian, the word stem bucurie means 'joy' ('happiness'), and it is believed to be of Dacian origin, hence the city Bucharest means 'city of joy'. Other etymologies are given by early scholars, including the one of an Ottoman traveller, Evliya Çelebi, who said that Bucharest was named after a certain 'Abu-Kariș', from the tribe of 'Bani-Kureiș'. In 1781, Austrian historian Franz Sulzer claimed that it was related to bucurie (joy), bucuros (joyful), or a se bucura (to be joyful), while an early 19th-century book published in Vienna assumed its name to be derived from 'Bukovie', a beech forest. In English, the city's name was formerly rendered as Bukarest. A native or resident of Bucharest is called a 'Bucharester'.</p>
          <p>As stated by the Mercer international surveys for quality of life in cities around the world, Bucharest occupied the 94th place in 2001 and slipped lower, to the 108th place in 2009 and the 107th place in 2010. Compared to it, Vienna occupied number one worldwide in 2011 and 2009. Warsaw ranked 84th, Istanbul 112th, and neighbours Sofia 114th and Belgrade 136th (in the 2010 rankings). Mercer Human Resource Consulting issues yearly a global ranking of the world's most livable cities based on 39 key quality-of-life issues. Among them: political stability, currency-exchange regulations, political and media censorship, school quality, housing, the environment, and public safety. Mercer collects data worldwide, in 215 cities. The difficult situation of the quality of life in Bucharest is confirmed also by a vast urbanism study, done by the Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism. In 2016, Bucharest's urban situation was described as 'critical' by a Romanian Order of Architects (OAR) report that criticised the city's weak, incoherent and arbitrary public management policies, its elected officials' lack of transparency and public engagement, as well as its inadequate and unsustainable use of essential urban resources. Bucharest's historical city centre is listed as 'endangered' by the World Monuments Watch (as of 2016). Although many neighbourhoods, particularly in the southern part of the city, lack sufficient green space, being formed of cramped high density block of flats, Bucharest also has many parks.</p>
          <p>Bucharest has landmark buildings and monuments. Perhaps the most prominent of these is the Palace of the Parliament, built in the 1980s during the reign of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu. The largest Parliament building in the world, the palace houses the Romanian Parliament (the Chamber of Deputies, and the Senate), as well as the National Museum of Contemporary Art. The building boasts one of the largest convention centres in the world. Another landmark in Bucharest is Arcul de Triumf (The Triumphal Arch), built in its current form in 1935 and modelled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. A newer landmark of the city is the Memorial of Rebirth, a stylised marble pillar unveiled in 2005 to commemorate the victims of the Romanian Revolution of 1989, which overthrew Communism. The abstract monument sparked controversy when it was unveiled, being dubbed with names such as 'the olive on the toothpick', (măslina-n scobitoare), as many argued that it does not fit in its surroundings and believed that its choice was based on political reasons.</p>

          <p>Iași, also referred to as Jassy or Iassy, is the second largest city in Romania, and the seat of Iași County. Located in the historical region of Moldavia, Iași has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Romanian social, cultural, academic and artistic life. The city was the capital of the Principality of Moldavia from 1564 to 1859, then of the United Principalities from 1859 to 1862, and the capital of Romania from 1916 to 1918.</p>
          <p>Known as The Cultural Capital of Romania, Iași is a symbol in Romanian history. The historian Nicolae Iorga said "There should be no Romanian who does not know of it". Still referred to as The Moldavian Capital, Iași is the main economic and business centre of the Moldavian region of Romania. In December 2018, Iași was officially declared Historical capital of Romania.</p>
          <p>At the 2011 census, the city proper had a population of 290,422 (making it the fourth most populous in Romania at the time). With 474,035 residents (as of 2015), the Iași urban area is the second most populous in Romania (after Bucharest), whereas more than 500,000 people live within its peri-urban area.</p>
          <p>Home to the oldest Romanian university and to the first engineering school, Iași is one of the most important education and research centres of the country, and accommodates over 60,000 students in 5 public universities. The social and cultural life revolves around the Vasile Alecsandri National Theater (the oldest in Romania), the Moldova State Philharmonic, the Opera House, the Iași Athenaeum, a famous Botanical Garden (the oldest and largest in Romania), the Central University Library (the oldest in Romania), the high quality cultural centres and festivals, an array of museums, memorial houses, religious and historical monuments. The city is also known as the site of the largest Romanian pilgrimage which takes place each year, in October.</p>
          <p>Scholars have different theories on the origin of the name "Iași". Some argue that the name originates with the Sarmatian tribe Iazyges (of Iranian origin), one mentioned by Ovid as Latin: "Ipse vides onerata ferox ut ducata Iasyx/ Per media Histri plaustra bubulcus aquas" and "Iazyges et Colchi Metereaque turba Getaque/ Danubii mediis vix prohibentur aquis". A now lost inscription on a Roman milestone found near Osijek, Croatia by Matija Petar Katančić in the 18th century, mentions the existence of a Jassiorum municipium, or Municipium Dacorum-Iassiorum from other sources. Other explanations show that the name originated from the Iranian Alanic tribe of Jassi, having same origin with Yazyges tribes Jassic people. The Prut river was known as Alanus fluvius and the city as Forum Philistinorum. From this population derived the plural of town name, "Iașii". Another historian wrote that the Iasians lived among the Cumans and that they left the Caucasus after the first Mongolian campaign in the West, settling temporarily near the Prut. He asserts that the ethnic name of Jasz which is given to Iasians by Hungarians has been erroneously identified with the Jazyges; also he shows that the word jasz is a Slavic loan word. The Hungarian name of the city (Jászvásár) literally means "Jassic Market"; the antiquated Romanian name, Târgul Ieșilor (and the once-favoured Iașii), and the German Jassenmarkt, may indicate the same meaning.</p>
          <p>Iași features historical monuments, 500-year-old churches and monasteries, contemporary architecture, many of them listed on the National Register of Historic Monuments. Notable architecture includes the Trei Ierarhi Monastery, part of the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Site, or the neo-Gothic Palace of Culture, built on the old ruins of the mediaeval Princely Court of Moldavia. During World War II and the Communist era many historical buildings in the old city centre (around Union Square area) were destroyed or demolished, and replaced by International style buildings and also a new mainly Mid-Century modern style Civic Centre was built around the Old Market Square (The Central Hall). The mid-1990s to early-2000s brought the first non-industrial glass curtain walled buildings (Romtelecom, Hotel Europa), while in 2012, in close proximity to the Palace of Culture, the Palas shopping mall and office complex was inaugurated.</p>

        <div class="info-section"><img class="back" src="img/back.svg" alt="back"><span>Constanța</span>
          <p>Constanța, historically known as Tomis, is the oldest continuously inhabited city in Romania. It was founded around 600 BC. The city is located in the Northern Dobruja region of Romania, on the Black Sea coast. It is the capital of Constanța County and the largest city in the region of Dobruja.</p>
          <p>As of the 2011 census, Constanța has a population of 283,872, making it the fifth most populous city in Romania. The Constanța metropolitan area includes 14 localities within 30 km (19 mi) of the city, and with a total population of 425,916 inhabitants, it is one of the largest metropolitan areas in Romania.</p>
          <p>The Port of Constanța has an area of 39.26 km2 (15.16 sq mi) and a length of about 30 km (19 mi). It is the largest port on the Black Sea, and one of the largest ports in Europe.</p>
          <p>As of 1878, Constanța was defined as a "poor Turkish fishing village." As of 1920, it was called "flourishing," and was known for exporting oil and cereals. Constanța is one of Romania's main industrial, commercial and tourist centers. During the first half of 2008, some 3,144 new companies were established in Constanța and its neighbouring localities, a number surpassed only in Bucharest and Cluj County. The Port of Constanța is the largest on the Black Sea and the fourth largest in Europe. The city also boasts a comparably large shipyard. Tourism has been an increasingly important economic activity in recent years. Although Constanța has been promoted as a seaside resort since the time of Carol I, the development of naval industry had a detrimental effect on the city's beaches. Nevertheless, due to its proximity to other major tourist destinations, Constanța receives a significant number of visitors every year, who discover and visit the city's monuments and attractions. Also, Constanța is a centre of commerce and education, both of which significantly contribute to the local economy.</p>
          <p>Situated at the crossroads of several commercial routes, Constanța lies on the western coast of the Black Sea, 185 miles (298 km) from the Bosphorus Strait. An ancient metropolis and Romania's largest sea port, Constanța traces its history some 2,500 years. Originally called Tomis, legend has it that Jason landed here with the Argonauts after finding the Golden Fleece. One of the largest cities in Romania, Constanța is now an important cultural and economic center, worth exploring for its archaeological treasures and the atmosphere of the old town center. Its historical monuments, ancient ruins, grand Casino, museums and shops, and proximity to beach resorts make it the focal point of Black Sea coast tourism. Open-air restaurants, nightclubs and cabarets offer a wide variety of entertainment. Regional attractions include traditional villages, vineyards, ancient monuments and the Danube Delta, the best preserved delta in Europe. The National History and Archaeology Museum is located in the old City Hall and has a very large collection of ancient art.</p>

        <div class="info-section"><img class="back" src="img/back.svg" alt="back"><span>Sighișoara</span>
          <p>Sighișoara is a city on the Târnava Mare River in Mureș County, Romania. Located in the historic region of Transylvania, Sighișoara has a population of 28,102 according to the 2011 census. It is a popular tourist destination for its well-preserved walled old town, which is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.</p>
          <p>During the 12th century, German craftsmen and merchants known as the Transylvanian Saxons were invited to Transylvania by the King of Hungary to settle and defend the frontier of his realm. The chronicler Krauss lists a Saxon settlement in present-day Sighișoara by 1191. A document of 1280 records a town built on the site of a Roman fort as Castrum Sex or "six-sided camp", referring to the fort's shape of an irregular hexagon. Other names recorded include Schaäsburg (1282), Schespurg (1298) and Segusvar (1300). By 1337 Sighișoara had become a royal center for the kings, who awarded the settlement urban status in 1367 as the Civitas de Segusvar.</p>
          <p>The city played an important strategic and commercial role at the edges of Central Europe for several centuries. Sighișoara became one of the most important cities of Transylvania, with artisans from throughout the Holy Roman Empire visiting the settlement. The German artisans and craftsmen dominated the urban economy, as well as building the fortifications protecting it. It is estimated that during the 16th and 17th centuries Sighișoara had as many as 15 guilds and 20 handicraft branches. The Baroque sculptor Elias Nicolai lived in the city. The Wallachian voivode Vlad Dracul (father of Vlad the Impaler (Dracula)), who lived in exile in the town, had coins minted in the city (otherwise coinage was the monopoly of the Hungarian kings in the Kingdom of Hungary) and issued the first document listing the city's Romanian name, Sighișoara. The Romanian name is first attested in 1435, and derives from the Hungarian Segesvár, where vár is "fort".</p>
          <p>The city was the setting for George I Rákóczi's election as Prince of Transylvania and King of Hungary in 1631. Sighișoara suffered military occupation, fires, and plagues during the 17th and 18th centuries. An important source for the history of 17th-century Transylvania, for the period of 1606–1666, are the records of Georg Kraus, the town's notary. The nearby plain of Albești was the site of the Battle of Segesvár, where the revolutionary Hungarian army led by Józef Bem was defeated by the Russian army led by Luders on 31 July 1849. A monument was constructed in 1852 to the Russian general Skariatin, who died in the battle. The Hungarian poet Sándor Petőfi is generally believed to have been killed in the battle, and a monument was constructed in his honor at Albești in 1897. After World War I Sighișoara passed with Transylvania from Austria-Hungary to the Kingdom of Romania. Central Sighișoara has preserved in an exemplary way the features of a small medieval fortified city. It has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Each year, a Medieval Festival takes place in the old citadel in July.</p>
          <p>Sighișoara is considered to be the most beautiful and well-preserved inhabited citadel in Europe, with authentic medieval architecture. In Eastern Europe, Sighișoara is one of the few fortified towns that are still inhabited. The town is made up of two parts. The medieval stronghold was built on top of a hill and is known as the "Citadel" (Cetate). The lower town lies in the valley of Târnava Mare river. The houses inside Sighișoara Citadel show the main features of a craftsmen's town. However, there are some houses that belonged to the former patriciate, like the Venetian House and the House with Antlers.</p>

          <p>Timișoara is the capital city of Timiș County, the 3rd largest city in Romania and the main social, economic and cultural centre in western Romania. Nicknamed the Little Vienna or the City of Flowers, Timișoara is considered the informal capital city of the historical Banat. The country’s third most populous city is the economic hub of the region, with 319,279 inhabitants as of the 2011 census, home to almost a half-million inhabitants in the metropolitan area, as well as ca. 50,000 students from over 50 countries.</p>
          <p>In late contemporary times, Timișoara, like many other large cities in Romania, is a medical tourism service provider especially for dental care. It also offers excellent academic institutions, attracting thousands international students annually mainly at its medical school. As a technology hub, the city has one of the most powerful IT sectors in Romania alongside Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Iași and Brașov, becoming a popular tech destination according to Financial Times. In 2013 Timișoara had the fastest internet download speed in the world.</p>
          <p>It was the first city in the Habsburg Monarchy with street lighting (1760) and the first European city to be lit by electric street lamps in 1884. It opened the first public lending library with reading room in the Habsburg Empire and built a municipal hospital 24 years before Vienna. Also, it published the first German newspaper in Southeast Europe (Temeswarer Nachrichten). It has been an important centre for music in Europe since the 19th century. The Romanian Revolution began in Timișoara. The city will be the next European Capital of Culture in 2021.</p>
          <p>The Hungarian name of the town, Temesvár, was first recorded as Temeswar in 1315. It refers to a castle (vár) on the River Timiș (Temes). The Romanian and German names (Timișoara and Temeschwar, respectively) derived from the Hungarian form. The name of the city originates from the river which passes the city, Bega, initially known as Little Timiș.</p>
          <p>The first identifiable civilization in Banat region were the Dacians who left traces of their past. Nearby archaeological finds indicate settlements of Neolithic and Roman origins. From coin finds, it is known that the area was inhabited during Roman Dacia. Timișoara was first officially mentioned as a place in 1212 as the Roman castrum Temesiensis or Castrum regium Themes. The town was destroyed by the Tatars in the 13th century but Timișoara was rebuilt and grew considerably during the reign of Charles I of Hungary, who, upon his visit there in 1307, ordered the fortress to be fortified with stone walls and to build a royal palace. Italian craftsmen and architects were used. He even moved the royal seat from Buda to Temesvár between 1315 and 1323. Timișoara's importance also grew due to its strategic location, which facilitated control over the Banat plain. By the middle of the 14th century, Timișoara was at the forefront of Western Christendom's battle against the Muslim Ottoman Turks. Crusaders met at the city before engaging in the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396. Beginning in 1443, John Hunyadi used Timișoara as a military stronghold against the Turks, having built a powerful fortress. The land of Banat was attacked by the Ottomans in 1462 and 1476, and the city was repeatedly besieged by them in 1491 and finally in 1522.</p>
          <p>In 1552, a 16,000-strong Ottoman army led by Kara Ahmed Pasha conquered the city and transformed it into a capital city in the region (Temeşvar Eyalet). The local military commander, István Losonczy, and other Christians were massacred on 27 July 1552 while escaping the city through the Azapilor Gate. Timișoara has been an important economic centre since the 18th century when the Habsburg administration was installed. Due to Austrian colonisation, ethnic and religious diversity and innovative laws, the economy began to develop. The technicians and craftsmen that settled in the city established guilds and helped develop the city's economy. In 1717, Timișoara became host to the first beer factory in Banat.</p>
          <p>During World War II, Timișoara suffered damage from both Allied and Axis bombing raids, especially during the second half of 1944. On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then was a member of the Axis, declared war on Nazi Germany and joined the Allies. The German and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, but without success. After the war, the People's Republic of Romania was proclaimed, and Timișoara underwent Sovietization and later, Systematization. The city's population tripled between 1948 and 1992. Timișoara became highly industrialised both through new investments and by increasing the capacities of the old enterprises in various industries: machine building, textile and footwear, electrical, food, plastics, optical, building materials, furniture. In December 1989, Timișoara witnessed a series of mass street protests in what was to become the Romanian Anti-Communist Revolution. On 20 December, three days after bloodshed began there, Timișoara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Arch of Triumph</span>
            <p>Arch of Triumph is a triumphal arch located in the northern part of Bucharest, on the Kiseleff Road. The first, wooden, triumphal arch was built hurriedly, after Romania gained its independence (1878), so that the victorious troops could march under it. Another arch with concrete skeleton and plaster exterior of elaborate sculptures and decoration designed by Petre Antonescu was built on the same site after World War I in 1922. The arch exterior, which had seriously decayed, was replaced in 1935 by the current much more sober Neoclassical design, more closely modelled in the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The new arch, also designed by Petre Antonescu and executed in stone, was inaugurated on 1 December 1936. The arch has a height of 27 metres. It has as its foundation a 25 x 11.50 metres rectangle. The sculptures with which the facades are decorated were created by famous Romanian sculptors such as Ion Jalea and Dimitrie Paciurea. Presently, military parades are held beneath the arch each December 1, with the occasion of Romania's national holiday. Elisabeta Palace, the current residence of the Romanian Royal Family, is located near the Arch of Triumph, in Herăstrău Park.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Romanian Athenaeum</span>
            <p>The Romanian Athenaeum is a concert hall in the center of Bucharest, Romania and a landmark of the Romanian capital city. Opened in 1888, the ornate, domed, circular building is the city's main concert hall and home of the "George Enescu" Philharmonic and of the George Enescu annual international music festival. In 1865, cultural and scientific personalities such as Constantin Esarcu, V. A. Urechia, and Nicolae Creţulescu founded the Romanian Atheneum Cultural Society. To serve its purposes, the Romanian Athenaeum, a building dedicated to art and science, would be erected in Bucharest. The building was designed by the French architect Albert Galleron, built on a property that had belonged to the Văcărescu family and inaugurated in 1888, although work continued until 1897. A portion of the construction funds was raised by public subscription in a 28-year-long effort, of which the slogan is still remembered today: "Donate one leu for the Ateneu!" On December 29, 1919, the Atheneum was the site of the conference of leading Romanians who voted to ratify the unification of Bessarabia, Transylvania, and Bukovina with the Romanian Old Kingdom to constitute Greater Romania. Extensive reconstruction and restoration work has been conducted in 1992 by a Romanian construction company and restoration painter Silviu Petrescu, saving the building from collapse. The 9 million Euro required were contributed in equal shares by the government and the Council of Europe Development Bank. The overall style is neoclassical, with some more romantic touches. In front of the building there is a small park and a statue of Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu. Inside, the ground floor hosts an ornate conference hall as large as the auditorium above; the auditorium seats 600 in the stalls and another 52 in loge seating. A 75-sqm long and 3-m wide fresco by Costin Petrescu decorates the inside of the circular wall of the concert hall. Painted using the al fresco technique, the piece depicts the most important moments of Romanian history, starting with the conquest of Dacia by Roman emperor Trajan and ending with the realization of Greater Romania in 1918. Recognized as a symbol of Romanian culture, the building has been inscribed in 2007 on the list of the Label of European Heritage sites.</p>

            <p>The Palace of the Parliament is the seat of the Parliament of Romania. It is located on Dealul Arsenalului in the national capital city of central Bucharest (Sector 5). The Palace has a height of 84 metres, a floor area of 365,000 square metres and a volume of 2,550,000 cubic metres. The Palace of the Parliament is the heaviest building in the world, weighing about 4,098,500,000 kilograms. A colossal building, it was designed and supervised by chief architect Anca Petrescu, with a team of approximately 700 architects, and constructed over a period of 13 years (1984–97) in Totalitarian and modernist Neoclassical architectural forms and styles, with socialist realism in mind. The Palace was ordered by Nicolae Ceaușescu (1918–1989), the dictator of Communist Romania and the second of two longtime autocrats in power in the country since World War II, during a period in which the personality cult of political worship and adoration was in full force for him and his family. Known for its ornate interior composed of 23 sections, it houses the two houses of the Parliament of Romania: the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, along with three museums and an international conference center. The several museums hosted inside the Palace are the National Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Communist Totalitarianism (established in 2015) and the Museum of the Palace. Though originally named the House of the Republic when under its long period of construction, after the Romanian Revolution in December 1989 it became widely known as The People's House. Due to its impressive endowments, events organized by state institutions and international bodies such as conferences, symposia, and others take place there, but even so about 70% of the building almost four decades later still remains empty.</p>

            <p>The InterContinental Bucharest is a highrise five star hotel situated near University Square, Bucharest, in sector 1 and is also a landmark of the city. It is 77 m tall and has 25 floors, containing 283 guest rooms, operated by InterContinental Hotels Group. Designed by Dinu Hariton, Gheorghe Nădrag, Ion Moscu and Romeo Belea, it was part of a bigger project which included the building of the Bucharest National Theatre. Construction began in 1967 and was finished in 3 years. With its height of 77 meters, when it was opened on 23 of May 1971 it was the second tallest building in the city, after Casa Presei Libere. Although no longer holding that title today, it is still the tallest hotel in Bucharest. It became the hotel of choice for foreign press in Bucharest. Indeed, during the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the balconies of the InterContinental were a privileged point to report on the repression of the protests in University Square. In 2007 the hotel transitioned from the long-standing franchise agreement to a management contract with the InterContinental Hotels Group. The building is designed so that each room has a unique panorama of the city. The highest 2 floors (21 and 22) contain a club lounge, conference rooms and a health centre with an outdoor terrace, indoor swimming pool and fitness centre. The Imperial Apartment at the 19th floor has two bedrooms and a total area of 240 square meters. The apartment contains white Italian walnut furniture polished with gold and Murano glass light fixtures. In its living room there is a fully functioning Steinway & Sons white piano which was specially brought in for Nigel Kennedy's stay at the hotel in winter 2007.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>University Square</span>
            <p>University Square is located in downtown Bucharest, near the University of Bucharest. It is served by Universitate metro station. Four statues can be found in the University Square, in front of the University; they depict Ion Heliade Rădulescu (1879), Michael the Brave (1874), Gheorghe Lazăr (1889) and Spiru Haret (1932). The Ion Luca Caragiale Bucharest National Theatre and the Intercontinental Hotel (one of the tallest buildings in Bucharest) are also located near University Square. University Square marks the northeastern boundary of the Old Center of Bucharest. In the 15th century, here was the northern limit of the city. Around 1700, the limit was already around what is today Roman Square. Thought to define the axes north–south and east–west of the city after 1880, "the great crossroad" follows the Haussmannian scenario of urban modernization – in the spirit of the Parisian influence of those times. This intersection has never evolved as a monumental square, but emerged as most important road junction of the capital at the geometric center of the city. The Bucharest boulevards of those times hosted tram lines, and in the center of the intersection was placed the monument dedicated to Ion I. C. Brătianu, the square then bearing his name. Today this place is called 21 December 1989 Square, in honor of those who died during the Romanian Revolution. This square was part of an east–west axis full of important monuments, starting in the east with Rosetti Square and culminating with the statue of Mihail Kogălniceanu in the eponymous square. University Square was established in 1857 as part of the creation of the University of Bucharest. In 1679 the Princely School was built here, which in the 18th century was to become the Princely Academy (a sort of university) and in 1818 St. Sava National School, then in 1857 the University of Bucharest. The University was built in several stages, following neoclassical aesthetic principles. The facade existing today was constructed between 1921–1943. Pedestrians can cross the streets only by University Passage, constructed in the socialist period during the development of M2 metro thoroughfare and leading, as well, to a metro station. The space that now extends from the InterContinental hotel and National Theatre once was home to an outdoor circus, around which existed shops with mititei (small Romanian sausages) and beer, and a stum shop named Zori de zi. All this disappeared after urban planning in the 1960s proposed the idea of developing the area through tourism, cultural or administrative functions. Between 1968 and 1970 the Hotel InterContinental (architects Dinu Hariton, Gheorghe Nădrag, Ion Moscu and Romeo Belea) was built, and the new National Theatre was constructed between 1964–1973 in the style of that period, the halls being equipped with top stage installations. Damaged during the 1977 earthquake, the theater was rebuilt 1982–1984, under the aegis of Cezar Lăzărescu, in a heavy form and lacking spectacular elements. The square was the site of the 1990 Golaniad, a peaceful student protest against the ex-communists in the Romanian government. The demonstrations ended violently when miners from the Jiu Valley were called in by president Ion Iliescu to restore order in Bucharest.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Colțea Hospital</span>
            <p>Founded by great sword-bearer Mihai Cantacuzino in the 17th century, Colţea Hospital was not only the first hospital in Bucharest but also one of the first bases of medical education in Romania. With a history of over three centuries, the hospital located in the heart of Bucharest is today one of the top medical institutions in Romania, operating in one of the most beautiful buildings in the center of the capital. Colţea Hospital is part of the Colţea architectural complex - a landmark of the modern Bucharest of the last century, and an important part of what the center of the capital is today. Moreover, this ensemble remained in the history of Bucharest as one of the most important and valuable constructions of the early 17th century. The story of Colţea Hospital began when Mihai Cantacuzino, a descendant of one of the oldest families in Europe - the Cantacuzino family, bought a small wooden church and the land around it to build the most important of his constructions, namely the Colţea monastery ensemble. This ensemble bears the name of Colţea Doicescu, the man who sold the land on which the small wooden church was built to the great sword-bearer Cantacuzino. The Colţea monastery complex, built between 1698-1714, included the large church, three chapels symmetrically arranged on the eastern, northern and southern sides of the church, and the first hospital in Bucharest, which is still functional and is known today as the Colţea Hospital. The hospital was inaugurated in December 1704, but completed in 1706. It was the first medical unit in Wallachia. In the beginning, the hospital had 24 beds (12 for women and 12 for men) and operated based on the model of the hospital of S. Lazzaro e Mendicanti in Venice, being funded with money from the monastery. However, it was not what the hospitals are today, but an institution specialized in health problems of the poor who were sick or disabled. During the reign of Ștefan Cantacuzino, a nephew of Mihai Cantacuzino, the entire architectural ensemble was surrounded by a wall and a gate tower, which was known as Colţei Tower. This was a landmark of the Bucharest of those times, being the tallest construction of the city in the 18th-19th centuries. It was demolished, however, in 1888, to make way for the future Brătianu Boulevard. In 1739, a fire seriously affected the buildings forming the Colţea complex, including the hospital and the church. They were rebuilt but the earthquake in 1802 and the neglect of some trustees led to the ruin of the old hospital. A project to rebuild the hospital began in 1836 and took five years. At the time of reopening, the hospital had 60 beds. Moreover, the Small School of Surgery was also inaugurated at Colţea, this being the first school of medical education in the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, which functioned until 1852. The Colţea Hospital was then expanded in the coming years. For example, the first specialized departments - medicine and surgery - were set up in 1859, followed in 1863 by the ophthalmology department. The first workshop of medical instruments was opened a few years later in 1869. In addition, the hospital also became the first base of the National School of Medicine during this period. Some of the personalities who worked at Colţea Hospital are Petre Herescu, Constantin Angelescu, Aurel Babeş, Vintilă Ciocâlteu, Bazil Theodorescu, and Nicolae Kretzulescu. However, this building didn’t survive either, being demolished and replaced in 1887. The last 100 years have also brought major changes to the Colţea Hospital. Nearly 20 years ago, in 1999, the Government decided to modernize the Hospital and the Colţea Church, an investment that unfolded over a period of about 10 years. The medical, hospitalization and outpatient health care facilities, as well as the educational and research facilities and the amphitheater, were revamped. Investments were also made in high-performance equipment. Moreover, the gardens were also renovated, while the statue of Mihai Cantacuzino, which still stands today in the yard of the Colţea complex, was also restored. Today, Colţea Hospital is one of the most modern medical units in Bucharest and in the country.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>National Theatre</span>
            <p>It was founded as the Grand Theatre of Bucharest in 1852, its first director being Costache Caragiale. It became a national institution in 1864 by a decree of Prime Minister Mihail Kogălniceanu, and was officially named as the National Theatre in 1875; it is now administered by the Romanian Ministry of Culture. In April 1836, the Societatea Filarmonica — a cultural society founded by Ion Heliade Rădulescu and Ion Câmpineanu — bought the Câmpinencii Inn to build a National Theatre on the site, and began to collect money and materials for this purpose. In 1840, Obşteasca Adunare (the legislative branch established under the terms of the Imperial Russian-approved Organic Statute) proposed to Alexandru II Ghica, the Prince of Wallachia, a project to build a National Theatre with state support. The request was approved on June 4, 1840. Prince Gheorghe Bibescu adopted the idea of founding the theatre and chose a new location, on the spot of the former Filaret Inn. There were several reasons to favor this locations: it was centrally located, right in the middle of Podul Mogoşoaiei (today's Calea Victoriei); the earthquake of 1838 had damaged the inn beyond repair, and it needed to be torn down. The August 13, 1843, report of the commission charged with building the theatre determined that construction would cost 20,300 Austrian guilder (standard gold coin) of which only 13,000 gold coins were available. In 1846, a new commission engaged the Vienese architect A. Hefft, who came up with an acceptable plan. Construction got under way in 1848, only to be interrupted in June by the Wallachian revolution. In August 1849, after Prince Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei took power, he ordered that construction be completed. The theatre was inaugurated on December 31, 1852, with the play Zoe sau Amantul împrumutat, described in the newspapers of the time as a "vaudeville with songs". The building was built in the baroque style, with 338 stalls on the main floor, three levels of loges, a luxurious foyer with staircases of Carrara marble and a large gallery in which students could attend free of charge. For its first two years, the theatre was lit with tallow lamps, but from 1854 it used rape oil lamps; still later this was replaced by gaslights and eventually electric lights. In 1875, at the time its name was changed to Teatrul Naţional, its director was the writer Alexandru Odobescu. The historic theatre building on Calea Victoriei — now featured on the 100-leu banknote — was destroyed during the Luftwaffe bombardment of Bucharest on August 24, 1944. The current National Theatre is located about half a kilometre away from the old site, just south of the Hotel Intercontinental at Piaţa Universităţii (University Square), and has been in use since 1973. The new edifice reconstructed from 2010 to 2014, was inaugurated to the end of the year 2014, and with 7 halls, as the Grand Hall with 900 seats, is the biggest and the latest theater edifice of Europe. Currently, the Bucharest National Theater presents its performances in four halls: Grand Hall (1,155 seats), Amphitheater Hall (353 seats), Atelier Hall (without a fixed scene, 94-219 seats) and Studio Room 99 (without fixed scene, 99 places). In over 150 years of existence, the Bucharest National Theater presented on stage many of the most significant pieces of universal dramaturgy.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>House of the Free Press</span>
            <p>The House of the Free Press is a building in northern Bucharest, Romania, the tallest in the city between 1956 and 2007. A horse race track was built in 1905 on the future site of Casa Presei Libere. A third of the track was removed in 1950 to make way for a wing of the building, and the race track was finally closed and demolished in 1960, after a decision by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. Construction began in 1952 and was completed in 1956. The building was named Combinatul Poligrafic Casa Scînteii "I.V.Stalin" and later Casa Scînteii (Scînteia was the name of the Romanian Communist Party's official newspaper). It was designed by the architect Horia Maicu, in the Stalinist style of Socialist realism, resembling the main building of the Moscow State University, and was intended to house all of Bucharest's printing presses, the newsrooms and their staff. It has a foundation with an area of 280x260m, the total constructed surface is 32,000 m² and it has a volume of 735,000 m³. Its height is 91.6 m without the television antenna, which measures an additional 12.4 m, bringing the total height to 104 m. Between 1952 and 1966, Casa Scînteii was featured on the reverse of the 100 lei banknote. On 21 April 1960, a statue of Vladimir Lenin, made by Romanian sculptor Boris Caragea, was placed in front of the building. However, this statue was removed on 3 March 1990, following the Romanian Revolution of 1989. On 30 May 2016, the Monument of the Anti-Communist Fight ("Wings") was inaugurated in the same place. Renamed Casa Presei Libere ("The House of the Free Press"), the building has basically the same role nowadays, with many of today's newspapers having their headquarters in it. The Bucharest Stock Exchange (Bursa de Valori București, BVB) was located in the Southern wing at one point.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>National Arena</span>
            <p>National Arena is a retractable roof football stadium in Bucharest, Romania, which opened in 2011, on the site of the original "Stadionul Național", which was demolished from 2007 to 2008. The stadium hosts major football matches including home matches of the Romania national football team, and the Cupa României Final. The stadium is also the home of Liga I football clubs FCSB and Dinamo București.With 55,634 seats, it is the largest football stadium in Romania. Designed by Gerkan, Marg and Partners, the stadium was built by German firm Max Bögl and Italian firm Astaldi. A UEFA category four stadium, Arena Națională hosted the 2012 UEFA Europa League Final, and will host four games at UEFA Euro 2020 (including the quarter-finals). The stadium also hosts music concerts. The old stadium was demolished between 18 December 2007 and 20 February 2008, although a symbolic removal of seats took place on 21 November 2007, after Romania defeated Albania 6-1 in a qualifying match for Euro 2008. The construction phase generated some controversy over costs and delays, with Bucharest mayor Sorin Oprescu claiming that the works were 20 weeks behind schedule in May 2009. On 8 October 2009, it was decided that the stadium should also include a retractable roof worth €20,000,000. Construction was temporarily halted in December 2009 due to unfavorable weather conditions. The venue holds 55,634 people. 3,600 VIP seats are available, with another 126 seats allotted for the press (with a possible expansion to 548 seats). The stadium includes some 360 restrooms and a retractable roof, which can be opened or closed in 15 minutes. It is also endowed with a floodlight system and 2100 parking spaces. The roof design is very similar to that of the National Stadium in Warsaw. These two stadiums also have a similar capacity and age. The National Stadium is a Category 4 venue and as such, it hosted the UEFA Europa League 2011–12 final, as announced by UEFA at Nyon on 29 January 2009. It was required to host at least two major events beginning in July 2011, one with an attendance of 10,000 and the second with an attendance of at least 40,000. The official inauguration was initially scheduled for 10 August 2011, and was to feature a football match between Romania and Argentina. However, on 26 July, Argentina officially cancelled the friendly match after their manager Sergio Batista departed the team, so the stadium was instead inaugurated on 6 September 2011, with a UEFA Euro 2012 Group D qualifier match between Romania and France. The game ended 0–0 in front of a crowd of 49,137. The highest audience for a football game was achieved at the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match between Romania and Netherlands, hosted on 16 October 2012, which brought 53,329 people to the stadium. The 2nd highest audience was achieved at the UEFA Europa League Final hosted on 9 May 2012. The game between the two Spanish teams, Atlético Madrid and Athletic Bilbao, brought 52,347 people to the stadium.</p>

            <p>The Fire Tower is a 42-metre high building in Bucharest, Romania, between Obor, Calea Moșilor and Nerva-Traian. It was used in the past as an observation tower by the firemen. It was built in 1890, two years after the previous watchtower, Turnul Colței, built in 1715, was demolished. The plans were made by George Mandrea, back then the chief-architect of Bucharest. The Fire Tower had a double role, as it was also designed to be a water tower, too. However, after the building was finished, the local water utility company (Uzina de Apă Grozăvești) had no pumps powerful enough to fill it with water. The Fire Tower was used by the firefighters until 1935, when it became ineffective, as more and more high buildings were built in Bucharest, and introduction of the telephone reduced the need for a watchtower. In 1963, it was turned into a Firefighters' Museum.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Cotroceni Palace</span>
            <p>Cotroceni Palace is the official residence of the President of Romania. It is located at Bulevardul Geniului, nr. 1, in Bucharest, Romania. The palace also houses the National Cotroceni Museum. In 1679, a monastery was built by Şerban Cantacuzino on Cotroceni Hill in the first year of his rule on the place of an old wooden hermitage. The plans of this new monastery kept many of the traditional architectural elements found in the principalities of Romania at the time. The Cotroceni monastery was completed in 1682, and has since been visited frequently by many pilgrims and documented in various Chronicles. Cotroceni Hill was also the place of residence of many of Romania's rulers for a time until 1883, when King Carol I of Romania received the residences and ordered them demolished with plans to build a much larger edifice in their stead which would serve to house the future heirs to his throne. Construction of this new royal palace was commissioned to begin in the year 1893, the project being placed under the direction of French architect Paul Gottereau. During the rule of King Ferdinand I and Queen Marie, further improvements were made to the royal palace. At the request of Queen Marie, the north wing of the palace was completed with the space that would be used to house the maids of honor and adjutants in duplex apartments of sorts. A gymnastics hall at the semi-basement was also built, taking up the space where it is assumed that a chapel would have resided on the ground floor. On October 1915, the space was refitted to accommodate central heating. In 1925, Grigore Cerchez began his work on the Cotroceni Palace by adding a living room with a gazebo on the first floor. On the second floor, he added a small terrace on the northern face along with an additional gazebo. Cerchez continued to work on the two adjacent salons on the first floor of the north wing, as well as the Grand Reception Hall that distinguished this part of the building, until 1926. In 1929, Grigore Cerchez has achieved the functional completion of the north-eastern corner of the palace, having created a loggia at the library's level. Above the library, a large storage area was built as an annex to the royal dormitory. At the 30th day of December 1947, King Michael I was forced to abdicate by the communists. At that point, the new government had control of the palace which was then uninhabited by the royal family. On February 13, 1948, the new government held a meeting in which the destiny of the palace would be decided while an inventory of the royal goods was taking place. There were multiple requests for different functions the palace could serve, from a University of Medicine to a headquarters for the National Union of Romanian Students. On May 26 that year, decree number 38 was issued, in which the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the People's Republic of Romania has decided that "all goods and estates that were found from the date of March 6, 1945 in the possession of the former king Mihai and other members of the former royal family shall be passed into the possession of the Romanian state." Finally, on June 18, 1948, the Council of Ministers has decided that the Cotroceni Palace, its "five bodies, 150 rooms, park, the property of the state" would be placed under the administration of the Ministry of Interior. The same decree stipulated that other valuables found within the palace would be redistributed among various ministries, including the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health. After the new administrator of the palace has settled in, around 1,000 objects, including paintings, sculptures, icons, furniture, rugs, draperies, dishes, and other decorative items were missing. They were taken by the Ministry of Art and Information at the proposal of a special commission "to take objects of art from the Cotroceni Palace." The majority of the remaining objects were redistributed to various institutions and organizations, including the press arm of the Ministry of Art and Information, the "Bee" Society (Societatea "Albina"), and the restaurant union "Ambasador". In April 30, 1949, a school children's program called the "Pioneers" was about to receive its first group ceremony, which would mark a moment in the Cotroceni Palace's history in which it would be re-purposed for the use of these children who were preparing to become "dignified citizens devoted to their homeland and The Romanian Worker's Party." It was around this period of time when the Cotroceni Palace took on another name — Palatul Pionierilor, known in English as The Pioneers' Palace (also known as young communists). The retrofit was to take place in four stages, during which the building would allocate rooms for a bigger library and centers or workshops for chess, miniature aircraft, automobiles, radiophony, photography, painting, choreography & dance, history, and ceramics. In addition to the retrofits, the palace was also to be used as a cinema and auditorium. The Pioneers' Palace, however, was not inaugurated until June 1, 1950 — approximately one year after it was meant to be inaugurated. The Cotroceni National Museum is the old Royal Palace, built in 1895. In 1991 the palace became the headquarters of the Romanian Presidency and the old wing of the ensemble was opened to the public as Cotroceni National Museum, envisioned as an insight into past ages. You will see a number of function rooms, many of which were decorated to the whims of Marie, the English wife of Carol's heir, his nephew Crown Prince Ferdinand. You will also be able to view her astonishing art collection. Comprising approximately 20.000 objects, the collection of the Cotroceni National Museum has been continuously enriched through transfers from other institutions and museums and particularly through acquisitions and generous private donations.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Romanian Peasant Museum</span>
            <p>The National Museum of the Romanian Peasant is a museum in Bucharest, Romania, with a collection of textiles (especially costumes), icons, ceramics, and other artifacts of Romanian peasant life. One of Europe's leading museums of popular arts and traditions, it was designated "European Museum of the Year" for 1996. Located on Șoseaua Kiseleff, near Victory Square, the museum falls under the patronage of the Romanian Ministry of Culture. Its collection includes over 100,000 objects. First founded in 1906 by and originally managed by Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaş, the museum was reopened February 5, 1990, a mere six weeks after the downfall and execution of Nicolae Ceauşescu. During the Communist era, the building housed a museum representing the country's Communist party; the museum's basement still contains a room devoted to an ironic display of some artifacts from that earlier museum. The building, which uses traditional Romanian architectural features, was built on the former site of the State Mint. Initially intended as a museum of Romanian art, it was designed by Nicolae Ghica-Budești and built between 1912 and 1941. The building is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and National Identity. The museum was devastated during the June 1990 Mineriad, due to being confused with the headquarters of the National Peasants' Party. One of the museum's most famous exhibits—originally the work of Tzigara-Samurcaș—is "the house in the house". The house, which originally belonged to peasant Antonie Mogos of Ceauru village in Gorj County. From the first, the house was displayed in a non-naturalistic way: objects that would normally be in the interior were displayed in various manners outside; outbuildings were suggested by fragments. The Communist regime displayed the house much more conventionally, outdoors at the Village Museum; it returned to the Peasant Museum in 2002. The current display at the Peasant Museum revives the original non-naturalistic approach. For example, from a platform, museum visitors may peer into the attic, part of whose wall is stripped away; various objects are arranged inside. In 2002, the museum's exhibit space was greatly expanded as the museum store and offices moved into a new building behind the old one, freeing up a considerable amount of floor space in the museum proper.</p>

            <p>Victory Palace is a government building on the very large Victory Square in Bucharest, housing the Prime Minister of Romania and his cabinet. The Victory Palace was designed in 1937 to house the Foreign Ministry, and nearly complete in 1944. It was designed by architect Duiliu Marcu (1885–1966), who had designed many major buildings in 1920s and 30s Romania, including many major government projects in the 1930s and 40s. The Victory Palace is a stylised monumental classical design, with an arcaded ground level, a long colonnade of slim piers on the main front, and two recessed top floors. The facades were entirely clad in Carrara marble, with reliefs in the panels at either end, and there were generously decorated interiors. The building suffered heavy damage in the 1944 Bombing of Bucharest in World War II. It then underwent significant restoration and reconstruction works, being reclad in travertine, without the reliefs and less ornate interiors, finally opening in 1952, housing the headquarters of Foreign Ministry and the Council of Ministers. Following the Romanian Revolution, in 1990 it became the headquarters of the first government of post-communist Romania. The palace was declared a historical monument in 2004.</p>

            <p>The Palace of Justice in Bucharest was built between 1890 and 1895, and King Carol I himself attended the opening of the new headquarters of the institution. The neoclassical building visibly marked by Neo-Renaissance influences was the result of the conjoint efforts of two chief architects: Ion Micu, who was in charge with supervising the construction works as such and with conceiving the interior decorative details, and Albert Ballu, responsible with designing the building. The facade of the Palace of Justice is guarded by a number of decorative elements, of which the 6 allegorical marble statues, each of them symbolizing a certain justice-related principle, are the most notable. Located on the shore of the Dâmboviţa River, the Palace of Justice is both a historical monument and a work of art worth discovering by people who want to search out in depth the architectural patrimony of the capital, mostly if we take into account the restoration works carried out in between 2004 and 2006 have managed to keep close to the structural and decorative details of the original building, with no deviation from the authenticity and identity of the late 19th century edifice.</p>

            <p>The CEC Palace in Bucharest, Romania, built in 1900 and situated on Calea Victoriei opposite the National Museum of Romanian History, is the headquarter of CEC Bank. Before the construction of the palace, the location was occupied by the ruins of a monastery (Saint John the Great) and an adjoining inn. The 16th-century church was renovated by Constantin Brâncoveanu during 1702 - 1703, but later deteriorated and was demolished in 1875. The palace was built as a new headquarters for Romania's oldest bank, the public savings institution Casa de Depuneri, Consemnațiuni și Economie, later known as C.E.C., and nowadays CEC Bank. The land was bought and the building constructed with the institution's own funds. Work started on June 8, 1897 and was completed in 1900. The project was designed by the architect Paul Gottereau, a graduate of the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris; construction was supervised by the Romanian architect Ion Socolescu. In 2009, it was the venue for the 60th birthday celebrations of Crown Princess Margareta of Romania, and in 2015 it was also the venue for the 25th anniversary of the celebration of Crown Princess Margareta's charity (FPMR). Built in eclectic style, the palace is topped by a glass and metal dome. The entrance features an arch supported by two pairs of columns in composite style. The four corners are decorated with gables and coats of arms and ending in Renaissance domes.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Palace of Culture</span>
            <p>The Palace of Culture is an edifice located in Iași, Romania. The building served as Administrative and Justice Palace until 1955, when its destination was changed, being assigned to the four museums nowadays united under the name of Moldavia National Museum Complex. Also, the building houses the Cultural Heritage Conservation-Restoration Centre, and hosts various exhibitions and other events. The Palace of Culture is listed in the National Register of Historic Monuments. Located in the perimeter of the mediaeval Princely Court of Moldavia (from 1434), the construction was conceived as a rebuilding and expansion project of the former Princely Palace of Moldavia, dated to the time of Prince Alexandru Moruzi (1803–1806, architect Johan Freywald), and renovated by Prince Mihail Sturdza (1841–1843, architect Nicolae Singurov), from which it preserved the foundations and first two floors. It was from this latter building that the Palace inherited the legend of the 365 rooms, as many as the days within one year. The Romanian architect I.D. Berindei was assigned to plan and conduct the rebuilding process. Unlike the old palace, built in a neoclassical style, Berindei chose to design it in a flamboyant Neo-Gothic style. Started in 1906–1907, the construction works were halted during World War I, due to the limitation of resources, but the unfinished building sheltered Romanian and Russian troops, and different public institutions and military hospitals. The monument was finally completed on 11 October 1925, and officially inaugurated one year later, by King Ferdinand I of Romania. The building housed the County Law Court and other public institutions until 1955, when it received an exclusive cultural function. During World War II, the Palace sheltered German troops, and then, Soviet troops. In 1975–1977, the wood bridging from the last floor was replaced with a cement one, fixed with steel netting. The new bridging sustained the monument during the earthquake of 1977, but the bridging from the first floor, the walls, the ornaments and the relief works were affected. A large-scale restoration project, considered one of the most complex in Romania since 1990, began in 2008.[5] The main works were completed in April 2016. Between 1955 and 2010, the Palace of Culture also hosted the main branch of the Iași County Library. The Palace has 298 large rooms with a total area of 34,236 m2 (368,510 sq ft), 92 windows in the front part of the building and another 36 inside the building. Decoratively, the central hall shows a figurative mosaic including various representations of a gothic bestiary, concentrically arranged: two-headed eagles, dragons, griffons, lions. The hall is superposed by a glass ceiling room, where initially a greenhouse was arranged. In spite of its archaic-looking design, the Palace was designed so to integrate modern materials and technologies. Thus, the stone blocks were replaced with light and much cheaper materials. Besides, some rooms were decorated using a special material licensed by Henri Coandă, under the name of bois-ciment and imitating the oak wood. Decorative ironmongery elements are also remarkable and they can be admired for instance on the doors of the Voivodes’ Hall. The building was also equipped with high-tech facilities for those times, such as electric lighting, (pneumatic) heating, ventilation system, thermostat, vacuum cleaners, which were all directed from the machinery room, at the underground level. Taking also into account the 14 fires that affected the previous buildings, Berindei (the main architect) treated the wooden structure of the attic with an ignifugeous product called orniton, while for the roof he used a special material, named eternite.The entrance of the palace is through a great donjon tower, with crenels and alcoves dominated by an eagle with open wings. The tower is the central architectural piece of the palace. On each of the three exposed sides there is a face of the clock with a diameter of 3.25 m (11 ft). The clock faces are decorated with stained glass representing the 12 astrological signs. Two young men dressed in national costumes, are painted on the sides of the clock faces guarding the clock (design element inspired from the Peleș Castle). The stained glass windows and the cross shaped crenelations are electrically illuminated during the night. The Carillon in the tower has 8 bells that are singing each hour the Union Hora song with the help of a drum with 69 pins.</p>

            <p>Roznovanu Palace is the former residence of the Rosetti-Roznovanu family, built at the initiative of Iordache Neculai Roznovanu. It was inaugurated on 23rd April 1832 and at that time it was considered the most beautiful building in Iasi. The master of the palace had 3 wives. The last of them, Maria, was the one that opened the gates of the palace for musicians and literates. Here George Enescu and Haricleea Darcle had concerts, also here Mihai Eminescu lectured his poems. The dance parties offered by lady Marghiolita were famous in the whole region. In 1891, Vasile Pogor buys the palace from the Roznovanu family and establishes the headquarters of the City Hall. During 1893-1894, the building undergoes several changes (an additional storey is built and the chapel is demolished) and it becomes for a short time the residence of the royal family (Prince Ferdinand and Princess Maria). During World War I (1916 - 1918), the Roznovanu Palace hosted the headquarters of the ministries and the political leaders refugees from Bucharest. In 1918, the Romanian War Council met in the present Conference Hall of the Local Council. The building was restored after the fire in 1958, which destroyed almost completely the second floor and most of the ornaments on the first floor. The administrative leadership of the city moves to the present headquarters again in 1969. Today, in the former dance room of the Roznovanu family, the meetings of the Local Council are held, as well as other events of the City Hall.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Metropolitan Cathedral</span>
            <p>The Metropolitan Cathedral is the seat of the Romanian Orthodox Archbishop of Iași and Metropolitan of Moldavia and Bukovina, and the largest historic Orthodox church in Romania. It is dedicated to Saint Parascheva, to the Presentation of Jesus and to Saint George. Its form was inspired by the late Italian Renaissance style (Trinità dei Monti in particular), with Baroque elements dominating the interior and exterior decorative features. The Metropolitan Cathedral is listed in the National Register of Historic Monuments. Two churches previously stood on the site: the White Church (15th century) and the Presentation Church (17th century). On 8 August 1826, prince Ioan Sturdza signed a decree ordering construction of the cathedral; Metropolitan Veniamin Costache laid the cornerstone on 3 July 1833 and guided construction in its early years. Work began in 1833, using a neo-classical design by Viennese architects Gustav Freywald and Bucher, and continued at a rapid pace until 1841, in the latter years under the Russian architect Mihail Singurov. In 1839, after it was completely built and covered, serious cracks had appeared on the large central arch. Various solutions were attempted (in 1840 Singurov replaced the brick ceiling with wood, for example), but on 23 May 1857, the ceiling collapsed taking the interior columns with it, and the building remained ruined for decades. At the urging of Metropolitan Iosif Naniescu (1875-1902), the newly independent Romanian state decided to start the restoration work of the cathedral. A new cornerstone was laid on 15 April 1880. Architect Alexandru Orăscu, rector of the University of Bucharest, designed new plans that added two rows of massive pilasters to the interior, creating a rectangular basilica shape, with a central nave and two smaller side naves. The four detached side spires were kept, but the large central dome was eliminated and replaced with a system of four semicircular sections, separated by transverse arches. The cathedral was consecrated on 23 April 1887, in the presence of King Carol I and Queen Elisabeth, who had donated large sums for the project. In 1889, the relics of Saint Parascheva, patron saint of Moldavia, were brought from Trei Ierarhi Monastery and continue to attract crowds of pilgrims, particularly on her feast day (October 14). These are located on the right side of the vestibule, as are those of Veniamin Costache. Standing in the centre of the Metropolitan Complex, the Great Cathedral is a monumental building of a rectangular plan with four detached towers at its corners that originally flanked an immense dome. The cathedral is 56.70 metres (186.0 ft) long and 34.15 metres (112.0 ft) wide, and with a height of the towers of 52.92 metres (173.6 ft), it is one of the tallest historical buildings in Moldavia. The exterior of the Cathedral, as well as the interior, is decorated in the Baroque style. The eastern façade has a central motif formed of six Corinthian columns erected on a stone socle, which support the architrave, above which is a high bas-relief of the Presentation of the Lord. The western façade has eight columns separated by the entrance, above which there is a recessed balcony whose vault has a curved mosaic also showing the Presentation; above that is a stone carving of Saint George. The roof is decorated with zinc fleurons and stylized crosses adorn both the roof and the four spires. Gheorghe Tattarescu painted the icons and decorative elements in a style that respected Orthodox norms but also showed a Renaissance influence. The four Biblical scenes above the central nave, the saints' faces and the decorative compositions all show an Italian neo-classical rigor, to which the artist had been exposed during his studies at Rome's Accademia di San Luca. This creates harmony between the painting and the architectural style. The stained glass was worked in Munich and redone after World War II, under Metropolitan Justinian Marina. Two valuable icons painted in the 16th century are kept inside; they depict Christ Pantocrator and the Madonna and Child.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Golia Monastery</span>
            <p>Raised on the spot of a religious building from the sixteenth century, Golia Monastery’s Church was built between 1650 – 1653, during the reign of the ruler Vasile Lupu and of his son, Stefanita Voda. The monastery is surrounded by a stone wall, with towers at the corners, and also a bell-tower, 30 meters high, with 120 steps. By the end of the nineteenth century, the tower had a balcony where from a fireman watched over the city to give the alarm in case of fire. Nearby the tower, there was a pump since the period of Alexandru Moruzi, which has been put back into functioning during the summer of 2007. In the column house, built during the eighteenth century, lived temporarily the deacon Ion Creanga (the future writer who will buy a house in the neighborhood Ticau, known as “Bojdeuca lui ion Creanga” –Ion Creanga’s Hovel). The monastery was closed between 1900 -1947, and then it became parochial church until 1992 when it was reopen as missionary monastery. Inside, from the initial furniture there are still preserved: the royal thrones, a candelabrum bearing the marks of Vasile Lupu and four candlesticks. Many funerary stones and tombs from the pronaos and church’s porch show church’s importance during the past centuries. It’s also here that are buried part of the earthly remains of prince Potemkin, by 1791, and the first earthly ruler, after the Phanariots, Ioan Sandu Sturdza, by 1842. More than that, inside Golia Monastery’s Church were officiated the royal marriage ceremonies of Constantin Duca and Maria Brancoveanu, in 1693 and that of Antioh Cantemir with Catrina, in 1696, by the patriarch of Tzarigrad, Iacov. Today, Golia Monastery is a reference point for the citizens of Iasi but also for those visiting this city of Moldova. Monastery’s buildings shelter Trinitas Cultural-Missionary Institute, made up of the publishing house, the printing house and, since the spring of 1998, the radio Trinitas, broadcasting on the frequency 92,70 MHz, 24 hours a day.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Iași National Theatre</span>
            <p>The Iași National Theatre is the oldest national theatre and one of the most prestigious theatrical institutions in Romania. In 1956, it was given the name of the renowned Romanian playwright and poet Vasile Alecsandri. The first dramatic play presented in the Romanian language was Mirtil and Hloe, adapted and staged by Gheorghe Asachi, and held in the capital of Moldavia, Jassy/Iași, on 27 December 1816. In 1834, a Romanian production took place in Iași on the stage of the Théâtre de varieté, built in 1832 for the French Fouraux troupe. The National Theatre was founded on 15 May 1840, as the Great Theatre of Moldavia, when the Romanian language troupe, led by Costache Caragiali, was united with the French troupe, under a single direction of Vasile Alecsandri and the management of Costache Caragiali. On 22 December 1846, a new audience hall was inaugurated in the former mansion of Prince Mihail Sturdza, on the Hill of Copou. On the night of 17/18 February 1888, the theatre building was destroyed by the fire. The efforts to build the new theatre edifice culminated in 1894 when a contract was signed with the Viennese architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer, who designed several theatres and palaces across Europe, including the theatres in: Cluj-Napoca, Oradea, Timișoara and Chernivtsi. For the building work, a contract was signed with a Bucharest company, and the power station was built by a company from Berlin. The Theatre’s power station also supplied with electricity the 12 electric-arc lamps lighting the Theatre Square, marking the beginning of electrification in the city of Iași. The works to building took two years, and on 1 and 2 December 1896, the inauguration festivities took place with Flechtenmacher's National Overture, the vaudevilles Muza de la Burdujeni (The Muse from Burdujeni) by Costache Negruzzi and Cinel-cinel (The Riddle) by Vasile Alecsandri, as well as the verse comedy Poetul romantic (The Romantic Poet) by Matei Millo. Nowadays, the building also hosts the Iași Romanian National Opera. The Iași National Theatre building is listed in the National Register of Historic Monuments. With a Neoclassic exterior and a richly decorated interior in Rococo and Baroque styles, the building is considered one of the most elegant in Romania. The main auditorium is organised in stalls, boxes and a balcony. The curtain painted by the Viennese M. Lenz, presents in the middle, an allegory of life with its three stages and, to the right side, the allegory of Romanian Unification. The left-hand side, painted by Lenz’s apprentice, differs from the rest of the curtain in style and colouring. The ceiling and the iron curtain were painted by Alexander Goltz. The iron curtain, which completely separates the scene from the hall, shows ornaments placed symmetrically, while the ceiling has as a narrative basis the Archetypal Story, shown in paradisiacal allegories, with nymphs and cupids framed in rococo stucco. The 1,418 electric lights and the chandelier with 109 Venetian crystal lamps light up a playhouse with a unique architectural personality.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Alexandru Ioan Cuza University</span>
            <p>The Alexandru Ioan Cuza University is a public university located in Iași, Romania. Founded one year after the establishment of the Romanian state, by an 1860 decree of Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza, under whom the former Academia Mihăileană was converted to a university, the University of Iași, as it was named at first, is the oldest university of Romania, and one of its advanced research and education institutions. It is one of the five members of the Universitaria Consortium (the group of elite Romanian universities). The Alexandru Ioan Cuza University offers study programmes in Romanian, English, and French. In 2008, for the third year in a row, it was placed first in the national research ranking compiled on the basis of Shanghai criteria. In the 2012 QS World University Rankings, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University was included in the Top 700 universities of the world, on the position 601+ , together with three other Romanian universities. The University is a member of some of the most important university networks and associations: the Coimbra Group (CG), Utrecht Network, European University Association (EUA), International Association of Universities (IAU), University Agency of Francophony (AUF), and the Network of Francophone Universities (RUFAC). Iași has a long tradition in higher education, the first institute that functioned on the territory of Romania was Academia Vasiliană founded in 1640 by the Moldavian Prince Vasile Lupu, followed, in 1707, by Princely Academy of Iași. The Princely Academy (renamed, in 1812, The Academy of Filology and Science) matched up to the standards of the other European Academies of the time and the Romanian language gained importance over the Greek language. The foundation, in 1835, of the Academia Mihăileană is considered a landmark in the history of Romanian higher education. The Academia Mihăileană was created under the auspices of Prince Mihail Sturdza (hence its name), striving for progress and for "meeting the standards of the enlightened Europe". Three faculties were set up: the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Philosophy and the Faculty of Theology and the curriculum resembled to a great extent that of Austrian and German academies. After the Unification of the Romanian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia by the Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza, the inauguration, at 26 October 1860, of the University of Iași, the first Romanian modern university, was to be a stepping stone to modern higher education in Romania. By 1879, the University of Iași had four faculties: Law, Letters and Philosophy, Sciences, and Medicine. In 1892, the Faculty of Sciences added the Department of Organic and Inorganic Chemistry, followed by the Department of Agricultural Chemistry, in 1906, and the School of the Industrial Electricity, in 1910. In March 1937, the technical higher education departments were transferred to the newly established Gheorghe Asachi Polytechnic School, and in 1948, the Faculty of Agriculture became the Iași Agronomic Institute, while the Medical School became the Institute of Medicine and Pharmacy of Iași. Its coat of arms with the Y shaped heraldic pall symbolizes the three initiatives which led to the foundation of the University: the Academia Vasiliană, the Academia Mihăileană, the University of Iași. The central element is the Bible, the classic emblem of higher education. The three shiny stars stand for the three faculties of the University at its foundation moment, Philosophy, Law and Theology, on blue and argent background, the same colors used on the Cuza family shield. The university grounds lie on Copou Hill in the northern part of the city. The main university building, known as the University Palace, was erected between 1893 and 1897, and extended in 1933-1937, on the site of the first Iași National Theatre which had burned down in 1888. The Hall of the University, known as The Hall of the Lost Footsteps, served as a parliamentary debating chamber between 1917 and 1918 when, during the Great War, Iași was the capital of Romania. In 1968-1978, the painter Sabin Bălaşa created a series of strongly romanticized frescoes for the arcades. The University Palace is shared with the Gheorghe Asachi Technical University. Nowadays, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University is made up of 15 faculties and one department.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Central University Library</span>
            <p>The Mihai Eminescu Central University Library of Iași serves the University of Iași in Romania. The library was established on 8 November 1839 and opened on 23 November 1841, carrying on the tradition of the activity and fame of the old library of Academia Vasiliană, founded in 1640. Functioning closely with Academia Mihăileană, founded in 1835, it had the double character of a school library and a public library. In 1860, when the academy was transformed into the new University of Iași, the library became the Central University Library of Iași. However, its university character was soon changed again, for in 1864 the Regulation for Public Libraries transformed it into the Central State Library of Iași, with a national library profile but also playing the role of a university library. This double character continued until 1916, when the library once again assumed its current name. When it opened, the University of Iași had three faculties, not counting the theological section: Law, Philosophy, and Science. Scientific and technical specialisation of the different sections within the faculties began almost at once. After several management proposals made by Dimitrie Gusti in 1913 and 1914, the library was reorganised in 1932 according to the system proposed by B. Harms and W. Gülich. It was once again reorganised in 1948, after World War II. This had become quite necessary, as the library's collection had increased from 600 volumes to 1,500,000. By 2007 it had an additional million volumes. Among these are manuscripts, incunabula and rare books that entered the collection from monastic and private libraries, either by donation or purchase. Mihai Eminescu and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu both served as librarians-in-chief at this institution. From its foundation until 1860, the library functioned in the building of Academia Mihăileană (now destroyed). It was housed in the old university building (now the University of Medicine and Pharmacy) until 1897 and in the new university building (now the study hall of the Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iași) until after World War II, when it moved into the building of the King Ferdinand I Foundation's Library, the collections of which it now includes. This structure was built between 1930 and 1934 by the engineer Emil Prager following architect Constantin Jotzu's plans. The interior features Carrara marble and Venetian mosaic, while the exterior is decorated with Ionic columns, neo-Doric pilasters, small triangular pediments and medallions of important cultural figures.</p>

Waterfront terraces and numerous chic restaurants serving fish dishes can be enjoyed. In the summer, the bay of Tomis Harbor Tomis is often visited by groups of dolphins can be attracted by the beautiful water fountain in the middle or even by the tourists who walks quietly on the shore. Besides being a place for relaxation, Tomis Harbour is the ideal location to organize water sports activities.

            <p>The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, located at 25 Arhiepiscopiei Street, Constanța, Romania, is the seat of the Romanian Orthodox Archbishop of Tomis, as well as a monastery. Situated between Ovid Square and the Black Sea in front of the Archbishop's Palace, it was built on the city's peninsular zone in 1883-1885 following plans by architects Alexandru Orăscu and Carol Benesch and, for the interior, Ion Mincu. The cornerstone was laid on 4 September 1883, during the reign of Iosif Gheorghian, Metropolitan of All Romania. The church was consecrated on 22 May 1895. The building served as a parish church until 1923, when the Diocese of Constanța was established. In that year it became a cathedral, serving as such until 3 August 1941, when its altar and iconostasis, along with icons and paintings, were partly destroyed by aerial bombardment during World War II. It was restored after the war, from 1946-1951. Patriarch Justinian Marina and Bishop Chesarie Păunescu re-consecrated it on 14 January 1951; at that time, Păunescu's seat was moved from Constanța to Galați and the building once again became a parish church. Exterior repairs took place from 1957-1959. When the diocese at Galați became an archdiocese on 9 November 1975, a vicar bishop began serving at Constanța, returning the church to the status of cathedral, once again becoming an archdiocesan cathedral when the Tomis Archdiocese was revived in 1990. The cathedral, in Greco-Roman style, of pressed brick, has a wide facade and a 35 m tower. Among the sculpted works are the oak iconostasis and choir, as well as candelabras and candle stands (made of a bronze-brass alloy), also designed by Mincu and executed in Paris. The frescoes were done by two Bucharest painters between September 1959 and November 1965. That month, when they were finished, Bishop Păunescu consecrated the church once again. The relics of Saint Panteleimon, donated in 1931, along with part of the relics of Saints Auxentius of Bithynia and Simeon Stylites, are kept inside. Also present are an icon of the Virgin Mary, said to be wonder-working, and the relics of Saints Epictetus and Astion, discovered in August 2001. On 1 December 2001, the latter were deposited in the cathedral, which on that date acquired the additional function of monastery; since that time, liturgies have been held according to monastic rites. The Archbishop's Palace, begun in 1925, is located beside the cathedral, to the west. The cornerstone was laid by Patriarch Miron Cristea together with Bishops Grigorie Comșa of Arad and Ilarie Puiu of Hotin; Ilarie Teodorescu was then Bishop of Constanța.</p>

            <p>Grand Mosque of Constanța (Romanian: Marea Moschee din Constanța), originally known as the Carol I Mosque, is a mosque in Constanța, Romania. It is listed as an historic monument by the Romanian National Institute of Historical Monuments. The mosque is referred to by Constanța's Islamic community as the King's Mosque. The Grand Mosque of Constanța stands on the site of the former Mahmudia Mosque, built in 1822 by Hafız Hüsseyin Pașa and named after Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II. The Grand Mosque of Constanța was commissioned in 1910 by Romanian King Carol I. Construction began on 24 June 1910 with the first cornerstone laid in the presence of Spiru Haret, contemporary Romanian Minister of Religious Affairs; Sefa Bey, contemporary Ottoman ambassador in Bucharest; and the Ottoman consul in Constanța. The project was funded by the Romanian Government and entrepreneur Ion Neculcea, and finished construction in 1912. The mosque was officially inaugurated by Carol I on 31 May 1913. During the ceremony, Sultan Mehmed V bestowed the Order of the Medjidie upon chief architect Victor Ștefănescu. King Carol I also rewarded Ștefănescu with a watch. The mosque was built in Neo-Egyptian and Neo-Byzantine styles with elements of Neo-Romanesque architecture. Its designer, George Constantinescu, modeled the mosque after the Konya Mosque in Anatolia (Turkey). Victor Ștefănescu served as the chief architect for the project. Contractors used brick and stone materials for the mosque proper, and reinforced concrete for the dome and minaret. The mosque was the first structure in Romania to be built using reinforced concrete. The main portal was constructed using stone from Dobrogea, while the door beneath was constructed from black marble inlaid with bronze. The interior columns were constructed from marble from Câmpulung. The minaret was built in Neo-Moorish style and has a height of 47 metres. The dome has a height of 25 metres and a diameter of 8 metres.</p>

            <p>The National History and Archaeology Museum of Constanta is one of the richest museums in Romania and the second largest institution in the country, after the National History Museum of Romania from Bucharest. The cornerstone of the museum was laid in 1879 by Remus Opreanu, the first prefect of the Romanian administration of Dobrogea, in an attempt to counter the smuggling of antiquities discovered in archaeological sites of Constanta. For nearly a century, the Historical Museum of Constanta has experienced periods of decline and prosperity, being disorganized, reorganized and moved to different locations in the city. In 1977, the museum exhibits are permanently moved to its current headquarters in Ovidiu Square. The imposing building of the museum was built in the Romanian architectural style in the early twentieth century and served as the town hall until 1921. The National History and Archaeology Museum hosts an impressive heritage, consisting of over 430,000 objects dating from the Paleolithic to modern times. The museum apart from similar institutions in other counties in that, although the focus is on the history of Dobrogea, has also a national thematic area. The institution houses Greek, Romanian, Byzantine and medieval objects (stone, bronze and iron tools and weapons), ceramics, antique architectural elements (columns, capitals, pediments, scenery, etc..), ancient sculptures, glass vases, bronze statues, jewelry, coins (the collection includes silver, bronze and gold coins, some of them unique), icons, documents, maps, models, photographs, telegrams, magazines, objects of some personalities of the early twentieth century, furniture and other objects of great historical significance. The ground floor of the Museum of National History and Archaeology consists of two rooms where archaeological monuments of outstanding value, rare and unique pieces are exposed. In this section noted are: the Glykon Snake - a unique piece in the world, representing a deity of the romanian mythology (II century BC), the statuary group of Fortuna with Pontos - protective deities of  Tomis city and harbor (II-III century BC), the dual aediculae representation of Nemesis - one of the most remarkable parts of the Museum (II century BC) collections of gold jewelery, gems and cameos, silver vessels from Sucidava fortress etc. On the other floors of museum the exhibits are arranged chronologically, beginning with the first evidence of habitation of Dobrogea and ending with the modern era. Among these pieces is remarkable the "Thinker" and its pair emblematicpieces from the Hamagia culture (Neolithic). The History and archeology museum complex is completed by a large outdoor set of engraved and carved stones and by The Roman  Edifice of Mosaic, a unique monument in Eastern Europe by its size.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Constanța Casino</span>
            <p>The Constanța Casino is a defunct casino, located in Constanța, Romania. It has been designated by the Romanian Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony as a historic monument. The casino is on the Constanța seafront at 2 Elisabeta Boulevard along the Black Sea in the historic Peninsulă District of the city. The casino was built three separate times, with the first structure being erected of wood in 1880. It was designed to be a club and community center for elite and upper-class socialites willing to spend. Once considered Romania's Monte Carlo and a symbol of the city of Constanța, the most-recent and modern version was built in Art Nouveau style, also being the most important Art Nouveau building in the country, designed and built according to the plans of Daniel Renard and inaugurated in August 1910. The most modern version of the Casino was in operation for 38 years, with interruption due to the two world wars, attacked and bombed by Bulgarian and German troops in World War I, ravaged in World War II and, at one point, acted as a makeshift wartime hospital. In 1948 it was taken over by the Communist government becoming a House of Culture for the party until 1960 when it was handed to the National Office of Tourism. The last major repairs took place in 1986-1988, and the building is currently abandoned. The first version of the Constanța Casino was built of wood frame in 1880 and was named Cazin or Kursaal (“spa hall” in German). It was the first Romanian building to be built on the shore of the Black Sea shortly after Northern Dobruja came under Romanian administration as a result of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) and the Romanian War of Independence. The second version of the Casino was commissioned and built by the City of Constanţa and Mayor Belik at a nearby location and opened its doors in 1893. It was built and situated in approximately the same location as the current Casino and like its predecessor, it too was built of wood frame. It had a dance hall, several rooms but only one terrace to the sea. In May 1902, Captain Constantin Creangă petitioned the local mayor and city management to lease the building. He advertised himself as a chef, a skilled confectioner, and fluent in two commonly-spoken lingua franca of the time. He was successful and the building was transferred to his care for 2,000 lei a year, with the stipulation that he should "sell merchandise and products of only the finest and highest quality" and use "petroleum of the best quality on the property as to not produce any odor when burned" for light. In 1903, local politicians agreed that it was time for the city of Constanța to have a modern casino, "...like those which inspired the French Riviera". The Liberal government at the time immediately approved the project. The project was awarded to Daniel Renard, a Romanian architect of French descent who lived in Constanța. Daniel Renard was 32 years of age and a graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. His proposal to build an Art Nouveau structure stirred countless controversy, being supported by the Liberals in power but harshly criticized by the entire opposition. As the building's foundation was being cast, the politicians who appointed Renard were replaced. The construction was halted and Renard was quickly replaced with Petre Antonescu. Antonescu envisioned a theater-like building with two towers in the Neo-Romanian style and thus begins working on the new plans by pouring a second foundation. However, two years after Renard was removed the Liberal Party regained power in 1907. Renard was reappointed, resuming his project as he had envisioned from the beginning, in the Art Nouveau style. Renard had a third foundation laid. The third and current version of the Casino was inaugurated on August 15, 1910, in the presence of Prince Ferdinand. Speeches were held paying homage to King Carol I, Prime Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu, Minister of Public Works Vasile Morțun, and a performance by the Davilla Theatre troupe and a celebratory grand ball took place for Constanța's nobility and elite. After the opening, on March 15, 1911, Mayor Titus Cănănău of Constanța leased the building for one-year to Alphonse Heitz, owner of the Café de Paris restaurant in Bucharest. Plowing through political opposition, on the same day the contract was awarded, the County Commission authorized gambling, equipping the Casino with two billiard tables and 17 gambling tables for card games. In a short time, the casino in Constanța became one of the most popular establishments of its kind in Europe.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>The Clock Tower</span>
            <p>In every fortification system there is one fortress that dominates the others: the master-tower. The Clock Tower of Sighișoara is the main entry point to the citadel, opposite guarded by Taylor's Tower. With its 64 meters of height, the tower is visible from almost every corner of the city from Mures County, its purpose was to defend the main gate of the citadel and also served as the town hall until 1556. Now It's considered one of the most expressive clock tower in the whole Transylvania. The tower began to be built at the end of 13th century, It was built in the 14th century as a simple gate tower with a maximum of two levels: the ground floor and first two floors of the tower were made of sandstone and river rock, the first stage of the tower construction probably had a form identical to the Tailors tower. The thickness of the base walls were 2.35 meters, 1.30 meters on the second floor, stone tiles of basalt were used only at the corners. In the 16th century the old roof was demolished, they have added two floors built of brick and it was built a balcony and the roof. Nobody knows for sure how the roof was before the 1676 fire. The actual 5 turrets baroque roof with bulbs represents an exceptional achievement of the three Pilgrim masters: Veit Gruber from Tyrol, Philip Bong of Salzburg and carpenter Valentinus Auslander, who rebuilt the tower after the great fire of 1676 from March to September 1677 for 650 florins. What makes this tower unique in all the country is its clock with puppets inside. It's a symbol of Sighisoara, and, despite all the other towers that were owned and defended by different guilds, the Clock Tower was a public good. It used to host the Public Administration, and, during holidays, the city orchestra; since the end of 19th century though it hosts the History Museum of Sighisoara. Another important feature of this tower is the balcony which is the most important observation point of the city: the wide view allowed to sight eventual fires in time in order to reach promptly one of the nine places in all Sighisoara that could provide water. It was vital to prevent the spread of flames because at that time the city did not dispose of much water; it was necessary in fact to dig for 35m to find a source of water. The tower is a rectangular prism with massive walls, with a rectangular base measuring 12x8,66 meters, with four floors and an observation gallery. The current distance between the base of the tower and the base of the roof is 30 meters, and the height of the roof, from the base to the top is 34 meters, so the roof is taller than the tower. The base of the tower is crossed by two vaulted semi cylinder parallel passages dated 13th century, provided in the past with solid oak doors and metal gratings, whose traces can still be partially seen today. Tower carries many signs of local authority: the four turrets placed on the corners of the roof, 12.5 m high, are symbols of autonomy of the State, which can pronounce and execute sentences to capital punishment. Also the clock and some figurines on inside can be considered symbols of public authority, as the 1 meter diameter golden scope on the summit of the roof. The tower keeps two clock mechanism, one in wood and one in metal, correspondingly to the age of the crafts. Two facades (one facing the citadel, the second facing the lower city) hold a clock dial of 2.3 meters diameter, with black and gold hand-painted clock numbers.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Church on the Hill</span>
            <p>The Church on the Hill is an architecturally significant church located in Sighişoara, Mureș County in Romania.This church is the most important monument of religious architecture in Sighisoara and is one of the great churches of Transylvania, being the third largest. Located at an altitude of 429 meters, on the Hilltop School, the church dominates by its massiveness the entire city and it is visible from a great distance almost from all directions. Most researchers believe that a number of architectural details such as slightly misaligned position of the bell-tower and choir demonstrate an evolution in stages, over several centuries, in the construction of this church. Unlike the late Gothic monuments in Western Europe, the Church on the Hill is characterized on the outside by simplicity, especially since most Saxon churches were fortified and could not afford richer ornamentation of the exterior. In Transylvania, the transformation of the old Romanesque churches into Gothic churches took place between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, under the direct influence of the German school of architecture. Soon after the year 1400 a number of builders and craftsmen stonemasons of German origins began to spread new type of church-hall, substantially modifying old buildings. An inscription in stone tells us that the work began in 1429 and would be completed in 1488 under the patronage of St. Nicolae, but a number of development works continued in the following decades. The evolution of this monument was marked further on by two serious events. The first took place during the Hungarian siege in 1704 when the roof and the belfry were burned and the big bells collapsed. The other unfortunate event was the earthquake of 1838, when the choir vaults entirely collapsed and were later replaced with imitations in wood. The interior of the church is the direct consequence of the restorations in 1934, when a team composed by Gustav Binder, Gertrud Kroner, J. Misselbacher and F. Muller revealed the old frescoes that were covered with lime back in 1776. At that time the altar was decorated with four wooden sculptures representing the four evangelists in natural size. In the past, the legend says, there must have been twelve disciples of Christ made of sheet silver in natural size but robbed in 1601 by Cossacks. The exterior appearance of the church is due to restorations by Restauro Masserschmidt (1993-1999). During that time several changes inside the church occurred as well; by introducing a series of works of great artistic value and altars that were brought from others Saxon churches. Inside the Church on the Hill you can find the only ancient crypt in Transylvania. This crypt was devastated several times in the past as thieves believed they would find valuables in the tombs belonging to the city leaders. Inside the church there are also some monumental wood pews. The pews are very high, with 14 seats and high back gate showing decorations with vegetal stalks and zoomorphic birds. Another main feature is the 60 sarcophagi near the entrance. This church was painted entirely inside and partially outside. Fragments that could be saved from interior painting are today considered among the most precious murals in Transylvania. These paintings belong to the 14th-16th centuries and are works of several masters of Gothic and Renaissance painting. On the north wall of the choir you can see Christ’s Passion tools guarded by an angel with a few saints among whom stands St. Ursula and her arrow. Among the works inside the church you can find: „St. George fighting the dragon” represented in three scenes, „Archangel Michael weighing a soul”, „The evangelist Matthew”, „Veil of Veronica” with the image of Jesus carried by two angels, „Mother of Jesus Christ” and „The Judgement”.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Monastery Church</span>
            <p>The Monastery Church, also known as the Church of the Dominican Monastery, is a Gothic church formerly part of a medieval Dominican monastery in Sighişoara, Romania. The monastery was erected in 1289, and demolished in 1888. The monastery was one of a network planned by Paulus Hungarus (Paul the Hungarian) throughout the Kingdom of Hungary to act as a bulwark against heresy. Saxon nobleman Leonard Barlabassy gave the church an endowment. Between the inside and outside of the church there are some stylistic differences. If in the interior the Baroque style is prevailing, on the exterior the simple facades retain most of the elements of late Gothic architecture. The west facade is the most impressive, dominated by a triangular pediment equipped with three very tall gothic windows. After the demolition of medieval buildings located in the space between the church and the Clock Tower, on the southern side were built three vertical columns, which end at the top with three arches supporting masonry church. Inside the church architectural elements and artistic furniture typical of the early Baroque era are prevailing. Elements such as pillars and arches, the altar, pews, canopy, painted organ and balconies and Transylvanian rugs that adorn the church. The most important piece of furniture is a baptismal font made in bronze. This font is the oldest and most valuable piese of furniture art in the church. A Latin inscription is visible on the cup showing the scope of baptism: „Baptism banish the forces of evil and the devil” and specifying the name of the author of the artwork:”This work was made by the hands of Jacob, the one that makes bells, in the Year of Our Lord 1440”. The font was made in a local workshop in Sighisoara; it is 108.5 cm high and has 60.3 cm of diameter. The cup bell contains the inscription mentioned and it’s decorated with biblical scenes and lilies. A similar font, dating from the same period, is in the Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral, but it doesn’t have the same „grace” as the one in Sighisoara.</p>

            <p>The Holy Trinity Church is a Romanian Orthodox Church located on the northern bank of the Târnava Mare River, Sighişoara. As the seat of an archpriest and not a bishop, it is a church and not technically a cathedral, but is commonly referred to as such. It was built in what was known at the time as Elizabeth Park, commencing in 1934, after a proposal to build it in the town center was turned down. Building supervisors were Archpriest Emilian Stoica and Priest Aurel Stoicovici. The church cost 12 million lei: money that came from the management of a 300 arpents of forest that the church had been given in 1925; from donation of religious; from Ministry of Culture; from University of Germany; from the mayor of Sighisoara and prefecture of Tarnava Mare. The 31 October 1937 sanctification ceremony was led by Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan Nicolae Bălan. The ceremony witnessed the presence of 40 priests; 2 ministers from Bucharest and more than 10.000 people. The Holy Trinity Church, Sighişoara was designed in the Neo-Byzantine style. It was built in 1934-37 following the plans of architect Dumitru Petrescu Gopeş, with interior paintings done by the painter Anastasie Demian according to tempera technique. The iconostasis was built by two artists from Rupea, Schiopul and Babic. The smallest of the three church bells (350kg) was donated by the parishioners, the middle one (730kg) by Mayor Aurel Mosora, and the biggest one (1430kg) by County Prefect dr. Victor Stirbet on behalf of the county prefecture. The walls were repainted between 1980-84 according to fresco technique. During these years of repairs an underground chapel for funerals was built as well.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Union Square</span>
            <p>Until 1716, the square’s actual area was crossed diagonally from the south-east corner to the north-west one by the inner city’s defense wall. The fortification was made of earth, protected towards the outside by a massive timber logs palisade, plastered with lime. In front of the wall, to the outside, the fortress’ main moat lay. Damaged during the 1716 siege, the wall was later repaired. Starting with 1733, several projects were made in order to set up a square here. Only after 1740 the defense wall started to be demolished. Subsequently, the city’s moat is filled with earth, and the square is paved with natural stone. The last remnants of the fortification existed in the square until 1745 to 1746. Until after 1786, on the square area south of the Catholic Cathedral, forming the southern side of the Square’s east front nothing was yet built. Only afterwards was this Square’s fronton completely built and Unirii Square became a closed urban area. Finally, a very large square (150 x 110 m) was made in relation to the size of the fortified city of that time (the new fortifications, bastion-like, built between 1732 and 1761, have incorporated a much wider area than the earlier fortifications, the new ones being well beyond the current square). For three centuries, the square became the place of religious events, military parades and other political and prestigious cultural events. The square’s fronts were occupied by some of the city’s most important institutions. Today, the square is the largest reserve of Baroque architecture in the city. The most important buildings are the two cathedrals, the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox, now Serbian, as well as the Baroque Palace and the Trinity Monument, all belonging to the Baroque style – excepting some parts of the Orthodox Church, which are made in Classicist style. Later on, other buildings were raised belonging to other styles. In its current state, the square was set up between the years 1988 and 1989 (architect Serban Sturdza). By creatively processing the suggestions offered by the existing urban texture characteristics, combining the exuberance of the Baroque façades with the Cartesian severity of the Cetate district plan, the remodeling author gave the square new valences, which tend to transform it into a true “outdoor salon”.</p>

            <p>After the defeat of the Hungarian Republic established in 1849, Hungary was divided into the five "crown countries" (kronländer). Banat of Temeschwar and Serbian Vojvodina, with its capital at Timișoara, was one of them. A seat for the government of this crown country needed to be built. Thus, between 1855 and 1860, the Dicasterial Palace appeared, the biggest building in town at the time. It was built in the style of the Italian Renaissance, with architectural elements similar to those in the Palazzo Strozzi and Palazzo Pitti in Florence. In the year when the building was finally completed, Banat was once more adjoined to Hungary, therefore a seat for the government was no longer necessary, since Timișoara became the capital of the county. The Palace has three levels, with originally 273 offices, 34 servant rooms, 34 kitchens, 65 cellars, 27 storage rooms, all placed around three inner courtyards. Today, the Dicasterial Palace houses the Court House of Timișoara, the Timiș Tribunal and the Appellate Court.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Timișoara National Opera</span>
            <p>The Romanian National Opera is a public opera and ballet institution in Timișoara, Romania. It is one of the national opera companies of Romania. The Opera shares the same building with the Mihai Eminescu National Theatre in Timișoara. The first performance at the Timișoara Opera was on 27 April 1875, the inaugural concert being Aida by G. Verdi. On April 20, 1880 the building is devastated by the first fire. The theatre goes bankrupt and it is bought by the authorities, in charge of its recovery. Since investments were insufficient individual funds were needed. The government offered "eternal" property over twenty lodges and the right of inheritance. Later, in agreement with the owners, they are redeemed. The reconstruction, completed in 1882, keeps the original Renaissance style of the façade. After the second fire, which takes place in 1920, only the lateral wings remain intact. The reconstruction of the building begins on July 15, 1923, by architect Duiliu Marcu. On December 20, 1989, during the Romanian Revolution, a crowd of 40,000 gathered in the open space in front of the opera house. Some managed to enter the building through the rear, and a succession of figures representing factories and ethnic groups delivered speeches from the balcony. From that point, the revolutionaries controlled the opera and surrounding square, although representatives of the Ceaușescu regime briefly continued to hold the county council building.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Huniade Castle</span>
            <p>The Huniade Castle is an early 14th century Romantic and Neo-Gothic castle located in the city of Timisoara, Romania. The building is considered a Romanian Historical Monument and is documented as the oldest standing structure in the city. The Huniade Castle has served as the living headquarters for some of the greatest kings in the region. The historical castle has been ravaged repeatedly by natural disasters, wars, and various uprisings. Despite the numerous devastations it endured, one thing always remained consistent, the Huniade Castle always went on to be rebuilt. Although the Huniade Castle’s primarily role throughout history was that of serving as the headquarters for Kings and various other commanders of Timisoara, throughout the decades, the castle was also used for different purposes. The Huniade Castle has been used as a fortification shelter for nobles during a peasant uprising, it served as a weapons storage facility for the Habsburgs in between wars with the Turks, and it was also used as a torture facility where captured invaders were brutally beaten and executed. Since 1948 the castle has been used to host the National Museum of Banat. The museum includes departments for archaeology, ethnography, history, and natural sciences. It also contains the largest collection of archaeological objects of Banat. While Romania was under the rule of Ceausescu, the communist leaders changed the museum’s name to the “Timiş County Museum Complex” in attempts to erase the historical term of Banat from history. Today, due to ongoing renovations at the Huniade Castle, the museum has been relocated inside the city’s Maria Theresia Bastion. The Huniade Castle, in its centuries of existence, has been a key determining factor of some of the most significant roles in the development, survival, and formation of the city of Timisoara. Although it sustained extensive amounts of damage on numerous occasions throughout the decades, the castle’s highly fortified strategic location in the city’s center enabled it to evade ever being completely destroyed. Its story of survival throughout the ages is a true testament to the importance of the role that fortified castles played throughout history. Throughout the many decades of the original construction of the Huniade Castle, the building has been nearly destroyed and rebuilt numerous times. Although the castle underwent significant changes to portions of its design each time it was redone throughout the ages, the buildings main architecture remained relatively consistent. The first version of the Huniade Castle (1307 – 1315) was made of brick on a foundation of oak pillars using the Venetian system of fortification. The edifice was developed around a quadrilateral courtyard with corner cylindrical towers. It was located on an island, connected by a movable bridge, and sat just outside of Timisoara’s city center, the present-day area of Victory Square. The second major version of the castle was rebuilt under new strategic requirements of the century to include semicircular towers that were adapted to support the use of cannons and artillery as a means of defense. It was also enlarged and several buildings inside were completely rebuilt. The Huniade Castle, along with the city’s center, was surrounded by moats that provided an extra layer of defense against would-be invaders. Each following time the castle was destroyed and rebuilt it was slightly redesigned or enlarged to suit the needs of the era it existed in. Because of its strategic location and its significance as the headquarters of city rulers, great importance was always placed on redeveloping the castle in order for its occupants to be able to use it to its full potential.</p>

          <div class="info"><span>Timișoara Orthodox Cathedral</span>
            <p>The Timișoara Orthodox Cathedral is a Romanian Orthodox church in Timișoara, in the historical Banat region, in western Romania. The cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Timișoara and Metropolis of Banat. It is dedicated to the Three Holy Hierarchs, Saints Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian, and John Chrysostom. Built on an area of 1,542 m2 (16,600 sq ft), it has 11 towers, of which the central and the highest has a height of 90.5 meters. The Metropolitan Cathedral is listed in the National Register of Historic Monuments. The cathedral was raised between 1936 and 1941. The building's style (architect Ioan Traianescu) is Neo-Moldavian style, based on Romanian Orthodox, late Renaissance, Ottoman, and Byzantine architecture elements, such as niches under the eaves, ribbed star vaulting in the interior, and lacquered discs in a variety of colors. The church's interior and exterior paintings were created by the painter Anastase Demian. The difficult period that followed the structure's completion, that of Romania during World War II, prevented the paintings from being finished with the building. Demian's work went on for many years after World War II. Timișoara Orthodox Cathedral is home to many historic and artistic religious objects, including many vintage Romanian icon paintings. There is also a collection of early writings in Romanian. Examples include the 1648 Noul Testament de la Bălgrad ("The New Testament of Bălgrad") and the 1643 Cazania lui Varlaam ("The Homiliary of Varlaam").</p>
